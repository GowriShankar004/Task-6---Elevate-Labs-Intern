# Flask Portfolio (Ready-to-run)

## What this is
A minimal Flask portfolio app with:
- Home page (`/`)
- Contact page (`/contact`) with a functional POST form that prints submissions to the terminal
- Simple CSS and a placeholder profile image

## How to run locally
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install flask
   ```
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
4. To submit the assignment, create a GitHub repo, push these files, and paste the repo link in the submission form.

## Edit
Replace the demo text, projects, and `static/images/profile.png` with your real profile image before pushing.
